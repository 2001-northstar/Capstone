          That’s right, genius. Notes sound higher as you travel to the right,
          and lower towards the left. Now it’s time to learn how to identify
          each one of these black and white keys by name. Let’s start with the
          white keys.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you look closely, you’ll realize that the same 7 notes are repeated
          over and over. These notes are A B C D E F G. Whether it’s a teeny
          little keyboard like the one here, or a full-sized grand piano, the
          pattern of the notes is the same: A B C D E F G looped over and over
          again. Easy, right?
